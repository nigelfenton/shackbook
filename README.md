# ShackBook

Standalone ham radio logbook for Windows / Linux / macOS.

ShackBook is a Qt 6 desktop application that keeps a SQLite-backed QSO log and
pulls live frequency / mode information from any radio that speaks the **TCI**
(Transceiver Control Interface) protocol over WebSocket — AetherSDR,
ExpertSDR2, SunSDR, and others. It fills in callsign details automatically,
tracks awards, watches the DX cluster, and exports to **ADIF 3.x** and
**Cabrillo 3.0**.

It also ships an optional headless **server** for multi-station operating —
mirroring an N3FJP network, ingesting WSJT-X spots, and serving a live
Field Day score over HTTP.

## Features

### Logging
- **Live freq / band / mode auto-fill** from a TCI server (default `ws://127.0.0.1:40001`), with auto-reconnect
- **Find radios** (Tools → Find radios…) — scans for TCI servers and offers what it
  finds. Only servers that answer a real handshake are listed; a port that merely
  accepts a connection is not a radio.
- **Radios without TCI** — Icom, Yaesu, Kenwood and anything else
  [Hamlib](https://hamlib.github.io/) drives, followed through its `rigctld`
  (Settings → TCI → *Follow radio via*). Hamlib reports the **radio's own model**, so
  contacts are attributed correctly with no nickname needed. ⚠ Hamlib is not included —
  see [Following a non-TCI radio](#following-a-non-tci-radio).
- Quick QSO entry: callsign + RST sent/received + comment, then `SAVE`
- Real-time **duplicate-check** warning as you type a callsign
- Full-fidelity QSO editor (Core / Other Station / My Station / Contest / Notes & QSL)
- Filterable QSO table — text search across call/name/QTH/grid/comment, plus band / mode / contest selectors
- **Multi-operator logs** — one database per callsign, live *Switch Operator/Log*
- **Which radio made each QSO** — the radio's name is taken from the TCI
  connection, shown in the status bar while you work, and stored on every QSO
  (exported as ADIF `MY_RIG`). Because TCI reports the *application* rather
  than the rig — AetherSDR answers "AetherSDR" for any radio behind it — you
  can set a **nickname** per TCI host/port to tell two rigs apart. A QSO logged
  with no radio connected records none, rather than guessing.

### Callsign lookup
Three-tier autofill of an empty QSO's name / QTH / grid / state / country:
1. **Worked-before** — reuses details from your previous QSO with that station
2. **cty.dat** — bundled offline AD1C prefix resolver (country / continent / CQ / ITU zones)
3. **Online** — QRZ.com (XML, paid), HamQTH (free), and callook.info (US, no account)

### Awards & spotting
- **Awards panel** (Tools → Awards): DXCC / WAS / WAC / WAZ / grids, worked vs confirmed, chase lists
- **DX cluster** client with configurable login suffix and duplicate-login handling
- **POTA** spot integration
- **"How far?"** button — opens a PSK Reporter map of who's hearing you, filtered to your band
- **Section map** (Maps menu) — native ARRL/RAC section map, N3FJP-style

### Looking after the log
Your log is the one file in the shack that cannot be remade, so ShackBook
treats it that way — all of this happens on its own, with nothing to configure:
- **Verified backups** — a compacted snapshot taken at most weekly, and always
  before a database upgrade. Each one is reopened and checked before it counts
  as a backup. They live in a `backups/` folder beside the log.
- **Checked on open** — a fast integrity check every launch, the thorough one
  only if that finds something.
- **Quarantine and restore** — a log that fails its check has the damaged files
  moved aside (never deleted) and the newest verified backup put in their
  place, with a dialog explaining what happened. If there is no backup to
  restore, ShackBook keeps logging on the damaged file rather than locking you
  out mid-contest — but tells you clearly.

### Import / export
- **ADIF import** (File → Import ADIF) — whole-file, deduplicated, fast (proven on 16k+ record logs)
- **ADIF 3.1.4 export** with the full standard field set
- **Cabrillo 3.0 export** with operator-defined header categories

### Server (optional, for multi-station / Field Day)
A headless companion (`shackbook-server`) that:
- Mirrors a remote **N3FJP** network so its QSOs land in your log
- Ingests **WSJT-X** "Secondary UDP" spots (udp/1100) straight into the log
- Serves a **live ARRL Field Day score** breakdown over HTTP (`/api/score`)
- Exposes a REST API (`/api/qsos`) with schema versioning, audit trail, and soft-delete

All operator settings (MY_CALL, grid, power, TCI host/port, Cabrillo headers,
lookup credentials, cluster login) live inside the database — no external
config files.

## Build

Requirements:
- Qt 6.2 or newer with the `Sql` and `WebSockets` modules
- CMake 3.20+
- A C++17 compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The resulting binaries are `build/ShackBook` (the logbook) and
`build/shackbook-server` (the optional server), plus `.exe` on Windows.
On Windows, `build.bat` also handles the MSVC environment setup.

The unit tests are opt-in, and cover the durability layer, the APRS decoder,
and per-QSO radio attribution:

```sh
cmake -B build-tests -G Ninja -DSHACKBOOK_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-tests
ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure
```

On Windows, `build-tests.bat` does the same. A build is marked `-dev` in the
window title unless configured with `-DSHACKBOOK_RELEASE=ON`, so it is always
obvious whether you are running an installed release or something you built.

## Following a non-TCI radio

TCI is built into AetherSDR, ExpertSDR and SunSDR — if you use one of those, there is
nothing extra to install and you can skip this section.

Every other radio is reached through **[Hamlib](https://hamlib.github.io/)**, which drives
around 200 rigs and exposes them on a single network port via its `rigctld` program.
**ShackBook does not include Hamlib** — it is a separate project under a different licence,
and if you already run WSJT-X or fldigi you almost certainly have it already.

1. Install Hamlib (`apt install libhamlib-utils` on Debian/Ubuntu,
   `brew install hamlib` on macOS, or the Windows build from the Hamlib site).
2. Start it, pointed at your radio — for example an IC-9700 on `COM4`:
   ```sh
   rigctld -m 3081 -r COM4 -s 19200
   ```
   `rigctl --list` shows the model number for your rig.
3. In ShackBook, **Settings → TCI → Follow radio via → Hamlib rigctld**. The default
   host and port (`127.0.0.1:4532`) suit a local radio.

ShackBook tells you if it cannot find Hamlib, and lets you point at it if you installed it
somewhere unusual. **It will not start `rigctld` for you** — that program takes the serial
port exclusively, and a second copy fighting the first is a classic cause of CAT failure
mid-contest. Start it yourself, once, and leave it running.

## Database location

The QSO database is auto-created on first run (one file per operator callsign):

| OS      | Path                                                                  |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\G0JKN\ShackBook\shackbook-<CALL>.sqlite`                 |
| Linux   | `~/.local/share/G0JKN/ShackBook/shackbook-<CALL>.sqlite`                 |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/G0JKN/ShackBook/shackbook-<CALL>.sqlite`  |

`<CALL>` is the operator you chose at startup. The `G0JKN` folder is the
application's publisher, not your callsign — it is the same for everyone.

That one file is the entire log — copy it and you have copied everything.
ShackBook keeps its own verified backups in a `backups/` folder beside it (see
[Looking after the log](#looking-after-the-log)), but those live on the same
disk, so keep a copy somewhere else as well.
