// TciClient — WebSocket client speaking the EESDR TCI protocol.
//
// TCI (Transceiver Control Interface) is the wire protocol used by
// AetherSDR, ExpertSDR2, SunSDR / Expert Electronics radios.  Messages are
// short ASCII text, each terminated with `;`, of the form
//   command:arg1,arg2,...;
// We connect, send `start;` to request event streaming, then watch for
// `vfo:` and `mode:` events on RX 0 / VFO 0 (the primary receiver).
//
// Frequency on the wire is in Hz; we normalise to MHz for the rest of the
// app since that's how operators talk about freqs and how ADIF stores them.
//
// Auto-reconnect: if the socket closes for any reason, we retry with an
// exponential backoff (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 s) until the user explicitly calls
// disconnectFromServer().

    // dropped, never replayed on reconnect.

    // having no open socket to write to. False when nothing was written.
    // Flushed to the OS before returning, so a disconnect straight after
    // cannot strand it in the client's buffer. That does not mean the server
    // acts on it: AetherSDR drops a stop followed at once by a close

    // notification only to the OTHER clients (TciServer, "broadcast to all
    // other clients"), never to the one that asked, so without the GET the
    // requester never learns the new speed. It is delayed because AetherSDR
    // applies the set on a queued call: a GET in the same burst could read
    // the old value. Several sets in a row share one read-back.
    //
    // ⚠ The usable range is the RADIO's, and narrower on some backends:
